Harvey Mudd College supplies a plethora of student DJs that perform regularly around the 5Cs. As two currently aspiring DJs, we wanted to understand the technical workings of audio modifications and create a low-cost, functional deck so that we could perform for our friends. Therefore, this project seeks to build an operational two-channel DJ Mixer that manipulates audio files based on user inputs. Our mixer will be able to control the frequency and gain of audio input through an AUX cord based on physical inputs from the user. The FPGA will apply Finite Impule Response (FIR) digital filtering to the audio, based on user choosen EQ values passed in through the MCU. The audio is then passed into the MCU, where the onboard MCU DAC with Direct Memory Access (DMA) will output the manipulated audio to speakers. This repo holds the E155 Final project for Victoria Parizot and Audrey Vo.
